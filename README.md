# Advent of Code 2022

My Advent of Code 2022 solutions!

* Day 1 is written in OCaml.
* Days 2 and 3 are written in Swift (without Gradle.)
* Days 4 onward are written in Kotlin.
    * Each day is its own source set.
    * I switched templates around Day 10. My new template takes in an argument (`a` or `b`) depending on which part should be run.
